## ü§î What is Contribu?

üß™ Contribu is an open-source NFT project aimed at creating a community cooperation system where community members are recognized for their contributions that are currently impacting and helping their community grow.

üëæ Contribu leverages the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) to verify and reward members' contributions. Its algorithm is designed to help communities recognize members' contributions through dynamic NFTs that evolve based on accumulated points over time.

## What do we solve?

We have observed that in many communities, members' participation is very active when a project is starting. People are very inspired and excited to contribute. However, over time, members lose interest, and the participation that kept the community alive fades away.

#### We solve three important points:

- Motivation: Dynamic NFTs motivate members to stay active and keep contributing, as their status and recognition are directly related to their participation.
- Transparency and Verification: Contribu uses EAS to ensure that contributions are verified fairly and transparently.
- Equity in Governance: By basing votes on activity and contributions, Contribu ensures that decisions are made by the most committed members.

## How does it work?

To achieve our goal of fostering a culture of constant cooperation in blockchain communities, we rely on the following dynamics:

#### Initial setup

Community organizers can create their own Contribu Collection. Each collection is an ERC 721 compatible NFT contract launched in the chain of their choice. Each NFT represents the specific contributions of an individual within the community.

#### Mechanism

Community members will have a dynamic NFT that will change based on a points measurement representing each member's contributions.

If a member is inactive for a long period (determined by the community admins), the algorithm will start to deduct participation points from that person, and the NFT will mutate to adjust to the number of points.

## Use cases:

#### Open Source Projects:

Imaginemos un proyecto de c√≥digo abierto quiere incentivar a sus desarrolladores y colaboradores a seguir contribuyendo. Contribu puede recompensar a estos miembros con NFTs din√°micas que reflejan sus contribuciones, incentiv√°ndolos a seguir activos.

#### DAOs:

In a DAO, where members contribute by voting, proposing initiatives or participating in governance. Member contributions are recognized with NFTs, which could grant additional voting power or access to special forums.

#### Creative Communities:

A collective of digital artists wants to recognize collaborations and contributions within their community. Contribu can award dynamic NFTs to artists who collaborate on joint projects, participate in community events, or contribute to community promotion.
